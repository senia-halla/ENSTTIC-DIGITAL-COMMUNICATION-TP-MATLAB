# ENSTTIC-DIGITAL-COMMUNICATION-TP-MATLAB

This course is provided within the national higher school of telecommunications and ICT **-ENSTTIC-** during the **4th year** of the state engineering course in telecommunications

The objectif of the parctical work is to : 
* Become familiar with the implementation of signal digitization in Matlab.
* Types of codes online, the DSP, eye diagram, AWGN channel.
* lowpass equivalent, analytical signal, representation vector of signals on an orthonormal basis, scalar product for vectors or functions/signals, Euclidean distance, optimal detection for an AWGN channel.

Here you can found my solutions of the practical works, which includ :
 
* Signal Digitization: Quantification, Coding
* The generation and analysis of baseband signals: line coding, AWGN channel.
* The generation and analysis of bandpass signals: Digital modulations.
* Demodulation, envelope detection, receiver Optimal for one AWGN channel
* Optimum Receivers for AWGN Channels
* Digital Communication Through Band-Limited Channel
